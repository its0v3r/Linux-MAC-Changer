# Python Linux MAC Changer 1.0.0

## What is this script?

This is a simple MAC address changer created for Linux systems. 

## How to use?

The user can chose which interface he wants to change the MAC address (-i, --interface) and then provide the desired MAC address (-m, --mac). Still, the user has the option to use a random generated MAC address provided by the script (-r, --random). If the user don't pass any arguments, the script will ask for the user to input the peding information.
